// Create a basic server using Express.JS
// Follow Star Wars Extended.

// Node module dependencies: express, bodyParse for JSON, path... any others?

// Set up express app like Star Wars app.

// Set up body parser.

// Create array variables that will hold the data.

// Tables array that includes customerName, phoneNumber, customerEmail, customerID.

// Waitlist array will include the same information.

// Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages

// Route to home page /

// Route to make reservation page /reserve

// Route to booked tables page /tables

// Route to view table array

// Route to view waitlist array

// Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data.

// Route that gets table data and pushes it to tables page.

// Route when you click to make a reservation, posts to existing table reservations.

// Use jQuery to run AJAX calls to GET and POST data from users to the Express server

// app.get that will retrieve tables has to retrieve the reservations and the waitlist.

// app.post will need to check first if there's a table available.

// If there isn't a table available, it will send an alert, and add reservation to waitlist array.

// If there is a table available, it will add the table to the table array.

// Make sure to listen on port.

// We need a front end JavaScript file, like the embedded script in Star Wars that will link up table information.

// It will show tables booked and the waitlist.

// And it will have a function to clear tables.

// Also need to make sure the form page is an a href that will do the post, similar to star wars.

// Might need to do something from front end to get form stuff to work.
